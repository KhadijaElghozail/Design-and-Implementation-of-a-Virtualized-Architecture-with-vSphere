# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Virtualized-Architecture-with-vSphere
### Objective
In this project, we deployed a complete virtualized infrastructure using vSphere on VMware Workstation. 

The setup includes three ESXi hosts, one of which hosts the vCenter Server for centralized management. 

We created and configured multiple virtual machines on these ESXi nodes to simulate various services. These virtual machines provide essential services such as:

- SSH for secure remote access

- DNS (BIND) – to resolve domain names into IP addresses, enabling efficient communication between machines by hostname instead of IP.

- FTP (vsftpd) – to allow secure file transfer between users and servers in the infrastructure.

- Web Server (Apache) – to host and serve web pages and web-based applications.
